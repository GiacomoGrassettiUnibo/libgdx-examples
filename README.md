Here are a few libGDX games I made in Java. You can run them in your browser or download JAR files that you can run locally. None of them are finished, but they might help those who are interested in learning libGDX. They are basically the Java equivalents of some of the games in [play-clj-examples](https://github.com/oakes/play-clj-examples). All files that originate from this project are dedicated to the public domain.

* Breakout - [HTML5](http://oakes.github.io/libgdx-examples/breakout/) or [JAR](https://github.com/oakes/libgdx-examples/releases/download/1.0/breakout.jar)
* Dungeon Crawler - [HTML5](http://oakes.github.io/libgdx-examples/dungeon-crawler) or [JAR](https://github.com/oakes/libgdx-examples/releases/download/1.0/dungeon-crawler.jar)
* Minicraft - [HTML5](http://oakes.github.io/libgdx-examples/minicraft/) or [JAR](https://github.com/oakes/libgdx-examples/releases/download/1.0/minicraft.jar) [1]
* Super Koalio - [HTML5](http://oakes.github.io/libgdx-examples/super-koalio/) or [JAR](https://github.com/oakes/libgdx-examples/releases/download/1.0/super-koalio.jar) [2]
* Tetris - [JAR](https://github.com/oakes/libgdx-examples/releases/download/1.0/tetris.jar) [3]

[1] Based on Notch's [Ludum Dare entry](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=398)

[2] Based on a libGDX [test game](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/tests/gdx-tests/src/com/badlogic/gdx/tests/superkoalio/SuperKoalio.java)

[3] I used a bizarre technique in the tetris game, using a low-level libGDX feature to count the pixels on the screen. As a result, I was unable to compile an HTML5 version.
